# Godot Geometry Elements
All examples are created using ![Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) v2.1.5.stable
This repository is dedicated to introducing geometry in game development. For this reason some well known methods of mathematical library of the Godot Engine can be reimplemented in GDScript for purpose of education.

## Examples:
Objective of each example is to illustrate how selected geometry topics can be implemented and used in games.
Each example have 2 versions (only for porjects in Godot 2.1.5): <b>start</b> with framework for implementation and <b> final</b> containing actual implementation.   

### [2d_steering](/final/2d_steering) Godot 2.1.5 version
### [2d_steering](/godot_3/final/2d_steering) Godot 3.0 version

Introduction to vector manipulation by implementing basic 2d spacecraft steering using simplified Newtonian physics.

### [projections](/final/projections) Godot 2.1.5 version
### [projections](/godot_3/final/projections) Godot 3.0 version
Implementation of projections. Calculation of object spatial relation.
