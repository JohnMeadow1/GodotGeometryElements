# GodotGeometryElements
All examples created using ![Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) v2.1.4.stable
This repository is dedicated to geometry elements in game developement. 
Objective of each example is to illustrate how selected geometry topics can be implemented.

## Examples:
  1. 2D_stering - introduction to vectors
  2. projections - projecting vector to another vector determining object relations.
  3. bezier_curve - implementation of interactive BÃ©zier curves (linear, quadric, cubic)
