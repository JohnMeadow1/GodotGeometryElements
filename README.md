# GodotGeometryElements
All examples are created using ![Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) v2.1.4.stable
This repository is dedicated to introducing geometry in game development. For this reason some well known methods of mathematical library of the Godot Engine can be reimplemented in GDScript for purpose of education.

## Examples:
Objective of each example is to illustrate how selected geometry topics can be implemented and used in games.
Each example have 2 versions: <b>start</b> with framework for implementation and <b> final</b> containing actual implementation.   

### [2d_steering](/final/2d_steering)
Introduction to vector manipulation by implementing basic 2d spacecraft steering using simplified Newtonian physics.

### projections
Implementation of projections. Calculation of object spatial relation.

### [bezier_curve](/final/bezier_curve)
Implementation of interactive BÃ©zier curves: linear, quadric and cubic.
