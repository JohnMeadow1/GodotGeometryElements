# Godot Geometry Elements
All examples are created using ![Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) v3.0 (or later)
This repository is dedicated to introducing geometry in game development. For this reason some standard methods from mathematical library of Godot Engine are reimplemented in GDScript for purpose of education.

## Examples:
Objective of each example is to illustrate how selected geometry topics can be implemented and used in games.
Each example have 2 versions: <b>starting</b> with framework for implementation and <b>final</b> containing actual implementation.   


### [2d_steering](/final/2d_steering)

Introduction to vector manipulation by implementing basic 2d spacecraft steering using simplified Newtonian physics.

### [projections](/final/projections)
Implementation of projections. Calculation of object spatial relation.

### [bezier_curve](/final/bezier_curve)
Implementation of interactive BÃ©zier curves: linear, quadric and cubic.

### [targeting_solution](/final/targeting)

Implementation of two approaches for aiming:
#### Aim approximation used by manoeuvring rockets
#### Predictive aim based on quartic equation solution applied to projectiles with constant speed
