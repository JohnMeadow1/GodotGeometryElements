# GodotGeometryElements
All examples created using ![Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) v2.1.4.stable
This repository is dedicated to introducing geometry in game developement. For this reason some well known methods of mathematic libraty of the Godot Engine can be reimplemented in GDScript for purpose of education.

Objective of each example is to illustrate how selected geometry topics can be implemented and used in games.

## Examples:

### 2D_stering
Introduction to vectors.

### projections
Implementation of projections. Calculation of object spatial relation.

### bezier_curve 
Implementation of interactive BÃ©zier curves: linear, quadric and cubic.
